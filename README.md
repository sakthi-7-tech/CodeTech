# Task 4 - Sentiment Analysis using NLP 💬

This project is part of my internship at *CodTech. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We classify each tweet as either **positive* or *negative* based on its content.

---

## 🔍 Project Objective

- Clean and preprocess real-world tweet data
- Convert text into numerical format using TF-IDF
- Train a machine learning model (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Visualize positive sentiment words using a Word Cloud

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

- *File:* tweet.csv
- *Format:* CSV with 6 columns (no headers)
- *Content:* Sentiment140-style tweet data  
  Columns: Sentiment, ID, Date, Query, User, Text

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- WordCloud
