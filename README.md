# Task 2: Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Dataset Used
Titanic Survival Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

## Objective
To build a logistic regression model that predicts passenger survival based on features like Age, Gender, Pclass, etc.

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature encoding
- Logistic Regression model training
- Evaluation using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Model Accuracy
Achieved accuracy: **~80%** (may vary)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Deliverables
- `predictive_analysis.ipynb`
- `README.md`
